# ROCA detection tool

This tool is related to [ACM CCS 2017 conference paper #124 Return of the Coppersmithâ€™s Attack: Practical Factorization of Widely Used RSA Moduli](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17).

It enables you to test public RSA keys for a presence of the described vulnerability.

Currently the tool supports the following key formats:

- X509 Certificate, DER encoded, one per file, *.der, *.crt
- X509 Certificate, PEM encoded, more per file, *.pem
- RSA PEM encoded private key, public key, more per file, *.pem (has to have correct header -----BEGIN RSA...)
- SSH public key, *.pub, starting with "ssh-rsa", one per line
- ASC encoded PGP key, *.pgp, *.asc. More per file, has to have correct header -----BEGIN PGP...
- APK android application, *.apk
- one modulus per line text file *.txt, modulus can be
    a) base64 encoded number, b) hex coded number, c) decimal coded number
- JSON file with moduli, one record per line, record with modulus has
    key "mod" (int, base64, hex, dec encoding supported)
    certificate(s) with key "cert" / array of certificates with key "certs" are supported, base64 encoded DER.
- LDIFF file - LDAP database dump. Any field ending with ";binary::" is attempted to decode as X509 certificate
- Java Key Store file (JKS). Tries empty password & some common, specify more with --jks-pass-file
- PKCS7 signature with user certificate

The detection tool is intentionally one-file implementation for easy integration / manipulation.

## Pip install

Install with pip (installs all dependencies)

```
pip install roca-detect
```

## Local install

Execute in the root folder of the package:

```
pip install --upgrade --find-links=. .
```

## Dependencies

It may be required to install additional dependencies so `pip` can install e.g. cryptography package.

CentOS / RHEL:

```
sudo yum install python-devel python-pip gcc gcc-c++ make automake autoreconf libtool openssl-devel libffi-devel dialog
```

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev swig
```

## Usage

To print the basic usage:

```
# If installed with pip / manually
roca-detect --help

# Without installation (can miss dependencies)
python roca/detect.py
```

The testing tool accepts multiple file names / directories as the input argument.
It returns the report showing how many files has been fingerprinted (and which are those).

Example:

Running recursively on all my SSH keys and known_hosts:

```
$> roca-detect ~/.ssh

## PGP key

In order to test your PGP key you can export it from your email client or download it from the PGP key server such as
https://pgp.mit.edu/

You can also use `gpg` command line utility to export your public key:

```bash
gpg --armor --export your@email.com > mykey.asc
```

## Remote SSL/TLS ports

Create a file with a *.remote* extension and provide a list of address:port entries, one line per entry. Then simply run the tool against this file. For example:

```
$ cat checklist.remote
github.com:443
google.com:443
example.com:8080
$ roca-detect checklist.remote
```

## Advanced use case

Detection tool extracts information about the key which can be displayed:

```
roca-detect.py --dump --flatten --indent  ~/.ssh/
```

## Advanced installation methods

### Virtual environment

It is usually recommended to create a new python virtual environment for the project:

```
virtualenv ~/pyenv
source ~/pyenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade --find-links=. .
```

### Separate Python 2.7.13

It won't work with lower Python version. Use `pyenv` to install a new Python version.
It internally downloads Python sources and installs it to `~/.pyenv`.

```
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
pyenv install 2.7.13
pyenv local 2.7.13
```
